# Algorithm Complexity Calculator

## Overview

The Algorithm Complexity Calculator is an Android application designed to analyze and display the algorithmic complexity of user-defined code snippets. It effectively counts the frequency of operations within loops and provides an output of the overall time complexity in Big O notation.

## Features

- Analyzes `for` loops and nested loops.
- Computes frequency counts and total steps for algorithm statements.
- Supports generalized analysis using variables instead of fixed numerical limits.
- Displays results in a user-friendly table format.
- Determines the depth of loops and provides corresponding time complexities.

## Technologies Used

- **Android Studio**: Integrated Development Environment for Android development.
- **Java**: The primary programming language used to build the application.
- **GitHub**: For version control and collaboration.
- **Jira**: For project management and issue tracking.

## How It Works

1. **Input Code**: The user inputs a code snippet containing `for` loops.
2. **Analysis**: The application parses the code and analyzes the frequency of operations.
3. **Output**: Results are displayed in a structured table, showing:
   - Statement
   - s/e (statement/expression)
   - Frequency
   - Total Steps

## Example Input

```java
for (i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    sum += i; // Calculate the sum of natural numbers
}
```

### Expected Output

- **Statement**: `sum += i;`
- **s/e**: 1
- **Frequency**: n
- **Total Steps**: n

## Pseudocode

```plaintext
FOR each loop in input
    COUNT frequency of operations
    CALCULATE total steps
    DISPLAY results
END FOR
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/algorithm-complexity-calculator.git
   ```
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Build and run the application on an Android device or emulator.
